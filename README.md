## You Can Run but not Hide:  Improving Gait Recognition with Intrinsic Occlusion Type Awareness

This paper has been accepted as a WACV 2024 Oral paper.

Our code is built on top of the OpenGait framework. Please follow the setup instructions of the framework to run our models.

The gaitgl_GREW_occ_aware.yaml and gaitpart_GREW_occ_aware.yaml config files contain the necessary settings to run the occlusion aware model. Please enter the file path for the preprocessed GREW dataset in the dataset_root parameter of the config file. Please enter the file path for the occlusion detector model in the occlusion_detector_path parameter.
